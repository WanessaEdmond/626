Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to help the nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup understand the tool that can help them select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.
The target for my model is the Application type. We split it into two category, successful and unsuccessful. We added the names column back and attempted with different number of bin size. The EIN wwas removed since those numbers are unique for each. To get to a 75% accuracy, I increased the hidden layer to 180 and decrease the bin to 100. With that we were able to achieve the desired results.
